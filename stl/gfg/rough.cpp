/* Some of the key components of the STL include:
Containers: The STL provides a range of containers, such as vector, list, map, set, and stack, which can be used to store and manipulate data.
Algorithms: The STL provides a range of algorithms, such as sort, find, and binary_search, which can be used to manipulate data stored in containers.
Iterators: Iterators are objects that provide a way to traverse the elements of a container. The STL provides a range of iterators, such as forward_iterator, bidirectional_iterator, and random_access_iterator, that can be used with different types of containers.
Function Objects: Function objects, also known as functors, are objects that can be used as function arguments to algorithms. They provide a way to pass a function to an algorithm, allowing you to customize its behavior.
Adapters: Adapters are components that modify the behavior of other components in the STL. For example, the reverse_iterator adapter can be used to reverse the order of elements in a container.
By using the STL, you can simplify your code, reduce the likelihood of errors, and improve the performance of your programs.

STL has 4 components:

Algorithms
Containers
Functors
Iterators



1. Algorithms
The header algorithm defines a collection of functions specially designed to be used on a range of elements. They act on containers and provide means for various operations for the contents of the containers.
